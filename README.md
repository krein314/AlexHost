## AlexHost Reviews

AlexHost's new VPS offering in Bulgaria is just launched and already available for purchase, complete with a 15% discount promotion lasting for ten days. It's an excellent choice for those with web hosting needs in Europe and values resistance to copyright complaints. However, it is not the best option for hosting services intended for use within China due to higher latencies.
